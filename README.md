# Project Voltero

The virus causes much higher death rates in at risk individuals such as the elderly. But these groups
ofpeople still need to purchase neccessities. The app allows people to volunteer to do shopping for
people who should not be out shopping themselves.
- At risk individuals should be able to request items, with each item being a free text entry to allow flexibility
- At risk individuals should be able to put their delivery location on their profile (You must use the phone’s location services for this)
- Volunteers should be able to view all requests,and select requests to view the details
- Volunteers should be able to mark a requestas taken,so that only one person ends up buying the items on the list
- Volunteers should be able to view the requestor’s location so thatthey can use something like google maps to navigate there
- At risk individuals should be able to post messages of thanks on volunteers’ profiles

## API Reference
In our project we used the Mapbox API to get our 
built in map to work.

#### Mapbox API Description:
The Mapbox web services APIs allow you to programmatically 
access Mapbox tools and services. You can use these APIs 
to retrieve information about your account, upload and 
change resources, use core Mapbox tools, and more. Mapbox APIs 
are divided into four distinct services: Maps, Navigation, Search, 
and Accounts.

#### Changing the Token:
If they want to change the token, go to grade.properties 
file, and change 
MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN to their own private token
and in strings.xml, change mapbox_access_token to their public 
access token
